## Introduction

Thank you for considering contributing to `shadcn/vue`. To ensure a consistent codebase, please follow the established patterns when contributing code to `shadcn/vue`. This guide provides detailed information to help new contributors.

## Project Structure

The GitHub repository consists of the several folders. here's a quick view.

<VPImage
    alt="folder-structure"
    class="block" :image="{
        dark: '/diagrams/structure-dark.svg',
        light: '/diagrams/structure-light.svg',
    }"
/>

1. **packages** -
Contains source code for supporting `nuxt` as a module and the `cli` to add new components.

2. **apps/www** -
The main folder that holds the source code for the website and every `shadcn/vue` component. This folder contains important sub-folders and is a subproject with its own `package.json`.

3. **.vitepress** -
Contains the configuration and source code for `vitepress` and the `shadcn/vue` website.

4. **src** -
Hosts the main source code for every `shadcn/vue` component or demo and their documentation on the website.

5. **\_\_registry\_\_** -
Holds the registry file generated by `scripts/build-registry.ts` to serve components for the `cli`. This folder's content is auto-generated and should not be edited manually.

6. **scripts** -
Contains various helper scripts, such as `build-registry.ts`, which automatically generates the `__registry__` folder.

7. **content** -
This folder holds all the documentation for the `/docs` route. Each component has one `.md` file documenting the installation and usage of the component.

8. **examples** -
Holds all examples not part of `/docs`, like the [main page](/).

9. **lib/registry** -
The main folder hosts the source code for different styles of every component. This is likely the main folder you'll be changing.

We support two different styles for every component in `shadcn/vue`:

1. Default
2. New York

Every component added to the repository must support both versions, including the main source code and associated demos.

## SFC - Single File Components

Multiple components are integrated into one file in `shadcn/ui` - the React version of `shadcn` - while Vue only supports one component per file, hence the name Single File Component (SFC). In such cases, you need to create separate files for each component part and then export them all in an `index.ts` file.

See the [`Accordion`](https://github.com/radix-vue/shadcn-vue/tree/v0.10.2/apps/www/src/lib/registry/default/ui/accordion) source code as an example.

## Wrapping Radix-Vue Components

[Radix-Vue](https://www.radix-vue.com) hosts many low-level UI components that are used to build reusable components.
There are many cases that you need to wrap `Radix-Vue` components.

### Props & Events
All of the `Radix-Vue` compoennts expose their prop and emit types. We need to forward any props/events that are coming from outside to the `Radix-Vue` component.

To do so, we have a helper function named [`useForwardPropsEmits`](https://www.radix-vue.com/utilities/use-forward-props-emits.html) that combines props and events that must be binded to the child radix component.

To be more clear, the function `useForwardPropsEmits` takes in props and an optional emit function, and returns a
computed object that combines the parsed props and emits as props.

Here's an example from `Accordian` root component.

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import {
  AccordionRoot,
  type AccordionRootEmits,
  type AccordionRootProps,
  useForwardPropsEmits,
} from 'radix-vue'

const props = defineProps<AccordionRootProps>()
const emits = defineEmits<AccordionRootEmits>()

const forwarded = useForwardPropsEmits(props, emits)
</script>

<template>
  <AccordionRoot v-bind="forwarded">
    <slot />
  </AccordionRoot>
</template>
```

As you can see, `AccordionRootEmits` and `AccordionRootProps` types are imported from radix, combined with `useForwardPropsEmits` and then are binded using `v-bind` syntaxt.

### CSS Classes
There are cases when we want to accept `class` as a prop in our `shadcn/vue` components and then combine it with a default style on our `radix-vue` component.

In these cases, we can not use `v-bind` while `class` is declared as a prop, because this would lead in [double class binding](https://github.com/radix-vue/shadcn-vue/pull/241), so the `class` propert must be dealt specefically.

Take a look at `DrawerDescription.vue`.

```vue
<script lang="ts" setup>
import type { DrawerDescriptionProps } from 'vaul-vue'
import { DrawerDescription } from 'vaul-vue'
import { type HtmlHTMLAttributes, computed } from 'vue'
import { cn } from '@/lib/utils'

const props = defineProps<DrawerDescriptionProps & { class?: HtmlHTMLAttributes['class'] }>()

const delegatedProps = computed(() => {
  const { class: _, ...delegated } = props

  return delegated
})
</script>

<template>
  <DrawerDescription v-bind="delegatedProps" :class="cn('text-sm text-muted-foreground', props.class)">
    <slot />
  </DrawerDescription>
</template>
```

As you can see, we have created a computed property named `delegatedProps` to remove `class` from props, and only then bind
the returned value to our radix component (`DrawerDescription` in this case).

As for our class, we first declared it as type of `HtmlHTMLAttributes['class']` and used `cn` to merge tailwind classes from `class` prop and our own classes.

### Boolean Props
When you are building a wrapper for a component, in some cases you want to ignore Vue [Props Boolean Casting](https://vuejs.org/guide/components/props.html#boolean-casting).
You can either set default value as undefined for all the boolean field, or you can use [`useForwardProps`](https://www.radix-vue.com/utilities/use-forward-props.html) composable.

Take a look at `AccordionItem.vue`

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { type HTMLAttributes, computed } from 'vue'
import { AccordionItem, type AccordionItemProps, useForwardProps } from 'radix-vue'
import { cn } from '@/lib/utils'

const props = defineProps<AccordionItemProps & { class?: HTMLAttributes['class'] }>()

const delegatedProps = computed(() => {
  const { class: _, ...delegated } = props

  return delegated
})

const forwardedProps = useForwardProps(delegatedProps)
</script>

<template>
  <AccordionItem
    v-bind="forwardedProps"
    :class="cn('border-b', props.class)"
  >
    <slot />
  </AccordionItem>
</template>
```

Since `AccordionItemProps` type has atleast one boolean property, we need to use `useForwardProps` on the entire props object.

Note that `useForwardPropsEmits` use `useForwardProps` under the hood.

### Component as Root
Whenever your root component is a `Component` Primitive from vue, it's easier to use [`Primitive`](https://www.radix-vue.com/utilities/primitive.html) instead.

Let's take a look at `Button.vue`

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import type { HTMLAttributes } from 'vue'
import { Primitive, type PrimitiveProps } from 'radix-vue'
import { type ButtonVariants, buttonVariants } from '.'
import { cn } from '@/lib/utils'

interface Props extends PrimitiveProps {
  variant?: ButtonVariants['variant']
  size?: ButtonVariants['size']
  as?: string
  class?: HTMLAttributes['class']
}

const props = withDefaults(defineProps<Props>(), {
  as: 'button',
})
</script>

<template>
  <Primitive
    :as="as"
    :as-child="asChild"
    :class="cn(buttonVariants({ variant, size }), props.class)"
  >
    <slot />
  </Primitive>
</template>
```

You'll need to extend `PrimitiveProps` in your props to support `Primitive` component. In most cases you would also need a default value for [`as`](https://www.radix-vue.com/utilities/primitive.html#changing-as-value) property.

## Debugging
Here are tools and techniques that would help you better debug while contributing or even when developing your app !

### Install Vue Dev Tools
To easily inspect component props, attrs, events and more, you could leverage the [`Vue Dev Tools`](https://devtools.vuejs.org/) extension for browsers.

### Enable Custom Formmaters
Vue wrap values stores in a `ref` that when are logged, would reusult in a nested object and need manual inspection to reach the value stored in that ref.

You can Enable Custom Formatter in your browser to eliminate the manual part described before.

- [Firefox](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/devtools-user/custom_formatters/index.html)
- Chrome, Edge, Brave and other Chromium based [browsers](https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+enable+custom++formatter+chrome)
